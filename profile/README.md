# DC4EU - Digital Credentials for EU

This is a github org for the Digital Credentials for EU (dc4eu.eu) project. The DC4EU project is a Large Scale Pilot for the EU digital identity wallet. These repositories are used as an internal project repository and should not in any way be construed as the "official" EU wallet. Project members and stakeholders will find here hopefully useful code for the various acitivies within DC4EU. For inquiries about DC4EU please visit our main website https://dc4eu.eu
